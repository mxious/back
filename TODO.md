# To-do list until stable

Done to-do's are marked with ~~strikethrough.~~

1. Fix bugs (isn't that obvious?)
2. Discover functionality (people discover, trending posts, etc.)
3. Profiles
4. Comments and f*cking polling
5. Polling in the dash (I don't know how to work this one, I think I'll use server-sent events for this as an alternative to polling)
6. Unit testing (f*ck phpunit but it'll help us)
7. Alerts (will be done through server-sent events)
8. Search (easy peasy)
9. Settings (f*ck meter 5/10)
10. Other pages (easy af)
11. Things
12. Remove the dashboard controller, the Main controller is now the dashboard. I will do this myself
13. Tidy up the JS and end the spaghetti code-ness
14. Tidy up the CSS and HTML and remove the hackish shit
15. Push to stable
16. Git merge conflicts can go to hell
17. ~~EVENT DRIVEN DESIGN (EVENTS LIBRARY JESUS CHRIST.)~~
18. Remove the account events. I don't find it to be necessary at all.
19. Increase compatibility with older PHP  versions (I love the bleeding edge, I know <3)
